2. The application should print out "Mares do eat oats."

- Is it guaranteed to always do this?

- If not, why not?

Answer:

The program will almost always print out "Mares do eat oats."
However, this result is not guaranteed, because there is no relationship set / happens-before relationship
between "Key statement 1" and "Key statement 2".

3. Would it help to change the parameters of the two invocations of Sleep?

Answer:

Happens-before relationship is a guarantee that action performed by one thread is visible to another action
in different thread.
This is true even if "Key statement 1" actually executes before "Key statement 2" ,
a happens-before relationship is about visibility, not sequence.

4. How would you guarantee that all changes to message will be visible in the main thread?

Answer:

We can use join method to guarantee that the Key element 2 happens first.

In the main thread, retain a reference to the CorrectorThread instance. Then invoke join on that instance before referring to message
